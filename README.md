This is a very simple car game, which I'm showing how to create step by step
<br>

<h2>About</h2>
Please feel free to use my code to create your own projects and adapt it as needed.
<br>
I highly encourage to pick different car images and customize my design to
<br>
create your own unique application without too much effort :)
<br>
draw some trees along the way, add other types of obstacles such as roadblocks, flooding, etc.
<br>
maybe even load different enemy vehicle images each time they reappear on the screen.
