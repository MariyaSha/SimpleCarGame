<br>
This is a very simple car game, which I'm showing how to create step by step
<br>
in a YouTube tutorial: https://youtu.be/W-QOtdD3qx4
<br>
<h2>Update - May 10th 2024</h2>
Released an additional version of the game, based on Object Oriented Programming principles.
<br>
You can find it in the root directory under <b>cargame_oop.py</b>
<br>
Enjoy! :)
<h2>About</h2>
Please feel free to use my code to create your own projects and adapt it as needed.
<br>
I highly encourage to pick different car images and customize my design to
<br>
create your own unique application without too much effort :)
<br>
draw some trees along the way, add other types of obstacles such as roadblocks, flooding, etc.
<br>
maybe even load different enemy vehicle images each time they reappear on the screen.
